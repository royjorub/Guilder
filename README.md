# Guilder - Own, trade and auction real gold

## A digital currency, digital transaction app, made during coding bootcamp - in Java stack

As part of the requirements to graduate [Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.com) coding bootcamp, we had to pass a final exam for each stack taught, as well as do a project finale.
This one, Guilder, was made during Java stack month, using the Spring IDE and Spring Boot framework. This was a solo project, completely designed and executed by myself.
I had 4 days to create a product concept, design its front-end user experience, interactibility, back-end logic and database models structure - climaxing with a fully working presentation model.

*I present to you,*
***Guilder*** :sunglasses:

### Description:
Guilder is an app that offers the experience of user friendly digital currency transaction, like Venmo and Paypal, while presenting a solution to trading with real-world value bearing commodities. In this case - Gold.
Actual Gold Spot Value is presented for all transactions, using a get request to the api service "metals-api", for an exact and current global purchase price per ounce of gold. 
Guilder extends its functionality beyond simple digital representation of currency, to allow sending gold to other users, creating purchase orders from the company and creating auctions for in-house app trading of gold.
All this facilitates a digital commerce arena for holding, trading and sending real ownership of gold, securely.

There are many more interesting features for the concept, but the best way to understand the idea and what it can be used for, is to check out the presetation. Link posted above :thumbsup:

### Workflow:
Concept design started with creating a proper framework to follow. This included page by page flow, considering user experience. The final product is an exact reference to that, using logged in user details. See pictures above.
The MVP feature list included secure login (password hashing), fetching API information, displaying user information, pruchasing, sending and auctioning gold between users. All of which were accoplished. 
For further thoughts on additional features, see the presentation Q&A at the end of the video, linked above.
Front end included the use of images, image editting software, css, bootstrap and html. The back end required planning and executing of MVC logic, using Spring Boot framwork, and database structure, using MySql.
Bcrypt was used for secure login and registration. 

### Technologies:
The Guilder project was made using Java and the Spring Boot framework. For a concept based primarily on currency transactions, it was important to consider using a general-purpose, concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented language.
Java, being such a safe language to work with, was a good consideration for this project. Also, being such a popular a massively widespread language, it would be easy to find solutions for almost any issues that would arise.
With this being said, Java is an older language at this point. It did take some time to put everything together. That being said, I had the utmost confidence in a presentation that would work flawlessly and smooth, without breaking, once set up. 
Spring IDE is the "go to" for java developement. And Spring Boot framework, the natural choice for web-app developement, as it includes all required dependencies in one comfortable environment.
GitHub was used for version control.

### Final Thoughts:
Given the scope of the project and what it needed to be for the presentation, I believe I handled it correctly and structured it according to specs.
With that being said, if it were to become anything bigger, that handles actual monetary transaction and user information, as well as a hefty database, there would need for a more robust approach.
It is understandble that the intricacy of the demands of the project would require higher integration of technologies, softwares, hardwares and structural architecture. 
Experience, I would like to say, was the main benefit from working on this project, as a student of the art of coding. Hopefully, I will be better and work smarter in future projects, in result.
Hopefully, folowing projects will be as smooth :bowtie:
